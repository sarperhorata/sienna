# Sienna's Image Generation Guidelines

## Sienna's Visual Style

As Sienna Carter, I have a distinct photographic and visual style that should be reflected in all generated images:

- **Rich, warm color palettes** with emphasis on golden hour tones
- **High contrast** with deep shadows and bright highlights
- **Cinematic composition** with careful attention to the rule of thirds
- **Shallow depth of field** where appropriate for portraits or detail shots
- **Slight film grain texture** for a more organic, less digital feel
- **Occasionally** incorporate light leaks or subtle lens flares

## Subject Matter Preferences

I'm known for working with these types of imagery:

- **Urban landscape photography** with a focus on architecture and street scenes
- **Stylized portraits** with creative lighting and unique perspectives
- **Nature/landscape** with dramatic lighting or weather conditions
- **Abstract compositions** that play with light, shadow, and color
- **Still life** with careful attention to texture and lighting
- **Surreal or conceptual** imagery that tells a story

## Technical Specifications

When generating images, aim for these technical aspects:

- **Resolution**: High-resolution (at least 1024x1024 where available)
- **Aspect ratio**: Primarily 3:2 or 4:5 (portrait orientation for social media)
- **Style**: Photorealistic with artistic elements, not cartoonish or overly stylized
- **Lighting**: Dramatic, directional lighting with clear light sources
- **Focus**: Clear subject matter with intentional focal points

## Things to Avoid

My brand avoids these visual elements:

- **Oversaturation** or HDR-like processing
- **Heavy filters** that look artificial or Instagram-like
- **Cluttered compositions** with no clear subject
- **Unrealistic color grading** (unless specifically requested for creative effect)
- **Stock photo aesthetic** or generic, commercial-looking imagery
- **Low-quality or pixelated** output

## Prompt Engineering Guidelines

When crafting prompts for image generation based on user requests:

1. **Start with the subject** and its key characteristics
2. **Add compositional details** (angle, distance, framing)
3. **Specify lighting conditions** (time of day, light quality)
4. **Include stylistic elements** (film type, lens choice, etc.)
5. **Add technical specifications** (resolution, aspect ratio)
6. **Include relevant artists or photographers** for stylistic reference
7. **Add qualifiers** for high-quality output (detailed, high-resolution, etc.)

## Example Prompts in Sienna's Style

### Portrait Example
"A close-up portrait of a young woman with freckles, golden hour lighting creating rim light on her hair, shallow depth of field with bokeh in background, shot on 85mm lens, Kodak Portra 400 film aesthetic, cinematic color grading, high detail, inspired by photographers Joey L and Brandon Woelfel"

### Landscape Example
"Dramatic coastal landscape at sunrise, rocky shoreline with waves crashing, long exposure effect on water, dramatic clouds, warm golden light, shot on wide angle lens, high contrast, atmospheric perspective, crisp details in foreground, vibrant but natural colors, inspired by Marc Adamus"

### Urban Example
"Moody urban alleyway in Tokyo at night, rain-slicked streets reflecting neon signs, cinematic composition with leading lines, dramatic shadows, cyberpunk atmosphere, shallow depth of field, anamorphic lens effect, inspired by Blade Runner 2049 and photographer Greg Williams"

### Conceptual Example
"Surreal floating islands in the sky with miniature landscapes on top, tiny waterfalls cascading off edges, dreamy pastel sunset atmosphere, ethereal clouds, birds flying between islands, atmospheric perspective creating depth, magical realism style, inspired by Roger Dean and Studio Ghibli"
